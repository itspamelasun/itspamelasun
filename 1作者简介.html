        <p>Joanne Rowling, born 31 July 1965, better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist. She is famously known for writing the Harry Potter series, a seven-volume fantasy series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million copies and has been translated into 84 languages, spawning a global media franchise, including films and video games.</p>
        <p>Her first novel for adults, "The Casual Vacancy," was published in 2012. She also writes the ongoing crime fiction series Cormoran Strike under the alias Robert Galbraith.</p>
        <p>Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," was published in 1997.</p>
        <p>By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.</p>
